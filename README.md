# mean-normalization-data-separation
Mean Normalization and Data Separation is a project exploring feature scaling and data preparation techniques in machine learning. It includes a detailed implementation of mean normalization to distribute data evenly around zero and covers methods for separating datasets for training and testing models. Presented in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.
